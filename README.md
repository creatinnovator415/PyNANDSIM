# PyNANDSIM
A NAND FLASH SIMULATOR
Step 1. To create a NAND flash simulator in /Core/NANDCore.py.
Step 2. To create a signal controller for flash simulator in /scripts/Client.py
Step 3. You can send signal to the NAND flash simulator.

In the PyNANDSIM, we don't need to modify the core of simulator. Therefore, it's easy to embed the signal controller to your flash controller and create all types of flash what you want to add.
